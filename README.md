Here I will direct the course of Barrack's needs to take up the spotlight in lead of command on led &amp; commanding laws of firearms rights properly with full digestion for all in use once worded, split up in logic, then distributed rightfully for rally.

# NOTICE OF NEEDED DISCUSSION
- Laws needing debate stay up for argument until pulled down off of the cage-shelf, rendered in the hands of a caring, and loving shoaman; and then nurtured by his light of logical intelligence which is sturred into a pot with creation in values, and morals to blend. This sounds like a recipe for the future of our nations' 13 month long rider's campaign. Through this journey we will find a campaign in crusade quit pleasing to our unusual media-based palette of potential dishes in which we serve out to our peoples' public. The easier we break-down the bigger bytes, bits, and ideas; the less hazardous choking in "heated arguments" rather than cold, hard political debate will bring about much less dramatic outbursts, and especially stress rates among our congressional valuemen of chairs, cabinets and boards.

## Intuition is a Key to the Lock of the Gun:
### The Pyramid Schematical Point of View System 
--- if gun control is not an obstacle, then I don't know what is, and finding a loophole is not the answer; because a topic like this would bring sewing of oats into play for the political pens that sign the documents of The Act into law, and out of law each day as the tide turns. With U.S. we have natural lunacy in our blood, so heated debate quickly turns in angst against us on our favorite topics, and can soon become consumed by a malodramatic internal storm that becomes the public medias' cage/arena. If we look at the logical inside the obstacle, it's hard to see, because something like a gun can so easily take the life of a being whom their life had what worth to the majorty, over what worth to the majority was the reason for which the life was taken by gun-fire forcibly; accidentally, with cruel intent, with freedom and peace in mind in the long run or just as a fear-factoring tool.

# The Mind and The Hands:
* Tying a gun to a man is like giving him a magical property, one of which he can harnass in honor, and righteousness; or take up in contempt of the Lord's plan, in use to create a severing point in the minds' perspective of view in life or death, by altering their neighbors' reality with terroristic retaliation against a nation or a persons' nation.
